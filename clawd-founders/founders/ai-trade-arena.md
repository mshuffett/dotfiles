## Research Notes
AI/Agentic space - Building AI Trade Arena (agentic financial analysis tools). S20 batch. MVP stage. Has cofounders. BUT: prefers virtual for demo day, only 2/5 kickoff interest, virtual weekly meetings. Good space adjacency but low in-person commitment makes less ideal for your SF-focused group.
