## Research Notes
Data Context for AI Agents - adjacent but REMOTE - S20 batch. Two exited founders (was CTO of Tenderd YC S18, worked at PLTR). Building 'data context engine' that improves AI agent accuracy by >75%. Has cofounders, launched with revenue. BUT based in London with 'some presence in SF', prefers virtual weekly. Strong AI agents adjacency and prior exit, but location mismatch for in-person group. Wants to help organize and can bring 5 investors (Index, Accel, Khosla).
