## Research Notes
AI for LPs - adjacent - W24 batch. Pivoting Clarum from due diligence product to 'operating system for LPs' after cofounder departure. Now solo. Building MVP, SF-based. In-person weekly, 4/5 kickoff (Jan 12 start). Can bring 2 investors. Web research shows Clarum raised $500K, was doing AI-powered due diligence for PE firms. AI/fintech is adjacent but not in agents space. Earlier stage after pivot.
