## Research Notes
Strong AI/Agent adjacency - Building Superset, a terminal for running CLI agents in parallel. W25 + X26 batch = very recent YC experience. Launched with some revenue already. Committed to in-person weekly. Has cofounders. Wants 'well-ran GOH' and serious participants - good cultural fit. Can bring 2 investors. Perfect space alignment with AI agents.
