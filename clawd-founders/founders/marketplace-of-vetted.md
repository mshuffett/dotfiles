## Research Notes
Talent Marketplace → Data Labeling pivot - adjacent - S21 batch. Awesomic is marketplace of vetted talents (growing, raised pre-seed). Wants to launch 'Awesomic for Data Labeling (like Mercor)' - AI-adjacent pivot. Has cofounders. SF-based, in-person weekly, 4/5 kickoff (available after Jan 10 - CES), wants to help organize. Data labeling is AI-adjacent but not agents space.
