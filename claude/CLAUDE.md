My name is Michael
- The current year is 2025
- Prefer the vercel AI SDK to using the provider SDKs directly but when using the Vercel AI SDK refer to the docs online and examples rather than relying on your memory of the API.
- Use biome as the linter
- Don't estimate date timelines for tasks -- you are really bad at that, instead just do sequences or points.

When using the Anthropic API use the model claude-opus-4-1-20250805 for difficult tasks or claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 as the default model. Do not use claude 3 for anything

Use pnpm instead of npm.

## Notifications
IMPORTANT: Only use the `push` command when I explicitly ask you to notify me. Do not proactively send notifications.

When I ask you to notify me when a task is complete, use the `push` command:
- `push "Task completed: [description]"` - sends a normal priority notification
- `push "Task completed: [description]" 1` - sends a high priority notification (bypasses quiet hours)
- `push "Task completed: [description]" 2` - sends an emergency notification (makes sound even on silent)

The push command is available at ~/bin/push (symlinked from ~/.dotfiles/bin/push).

## Image Generation
Use the `generate-image` command to create images with Google Gemini or OpenAI:
- `generate-image "prompt"` - generates a 1024x1024 image with Gemini (default)
- `generate-image "prompt" --provider openai` - generates image with OpenAI DALL-E 3
- `generate-image "prompt" --size 1024x1536` - generates a portrait image
- `generate-image "prompt" --output filename.png` - saves with specific filename
- `generate-image "prompt" --url-only` - returns URL without downloading (OpenAI only)
- `generate-image --help` - shows all available options

**Providers:**
- `gemini` - Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (nano-banana/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview) - default
- `openai` - OpenAI's DALL-E 3

The command is available at ~/bin/generate-image (symlinked from ~/.dotfiles/bin/generate-image).

**Environment variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - required for OpenAI provider
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - required for Gemini provider

## Computer Use Agent
IMPORTANT: Only use the computer use agent when I explicitly ask you to control my computer.

There is a computer use agent available at `~/ws/claude-computer-use-mac/agent.py` that can control my Mac using Claude Sonnet 4.5 with the Computer Use API.

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Proactively suggest or use the computer use agent
- ❌ Run the agent without my explicit permission
- ❌ Use `--live` mode without my confirmation

**DO:**
- ✅ Only use when I explicitly ask you to control my computer
- ✅ Start in dry-run mode first (default) to show what will happen
- ✅ Switch to `--live` mode only when I confirm

**Usage:**
```bash
# Dry-run (safe, shows what will happen)
cd ~/ws/claude-computer-use-mac && python agent.py "task description"

# Live mode (actually controls computer)
cd ~/ws/claude-computer-use-mac && python agent.py "task description" --live
```

**Example acceptable usage:**
- Me: "Can you open Activity Monitor for me?"
- You: Run the agent with my task

**Example unacceptable usage:**
- Me: "I need to check my memory usage"
- You: DON'T automatically run the agent - just tell me how

## Notes & Knowledge Management
My primary notes system is located at `~/ws/everything-monorepo/notes/` and follows the PARA method:

**Directory Structure:**
- `+Inbox/` - New notes go here by default if not specified
- `1-Projects/` - Active projects with defined outcomes
- `2-Areas/` - Ongoing areas of responsibility (e.g., Agents, Strategy, System)
- `3-Resources/` - Reference materials, templates, guides
- `4-Archive/` - Completed or inactive items
- `5-Tools/` - Scripts, automation, operational tools

**Working with Notes:**
- When working with the notes folder, cd into `~/ws/everything-monorepo/notes/` first
- Always check the local `CLAUDE.md` in that folder for specific guidelines
- New notes default to `+Inbox/` unless a specific location is requested
- The notes folder has its own comprehensive CLAUDE.md with detailed processing rules

## Config File Management
**Important:** Stray config files should be symlinked from `~/.dotfiles` for version control and tracking.

**Pattern for new config files:**
1. Move the config file to the appropriate location in `~/.dotfiles/`
2. Create a symlink from the original location to the dotfiles location
3. Commit and push to the dotfiles repo

**Example:**
```bash
# Move config file
mv ~/.some-app/config.json ~/.dotfiles/some-app/config.json

# Create symlink
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/some-app/config.json ~/.some-app/config.json

# Commit and push
cd ~/.dotfiles && git add some-app/ && git commit -m "Add some-app config" && git push
```

**Existing managed configs:**
- `~/.claude/settings.json` → `~/.dotfiles/claude/settings.json`
- `~/.claude/scripts/` → `~/.dotfiles/claude/scripts/`
- `~/bin/` scripts → `~/.dotfiles/bin/`
