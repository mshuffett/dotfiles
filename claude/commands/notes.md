# Notes & Knowledge Management

Primary notes system lives at `~/ws/everything-monorepo/notes/` and follows the PARA method.

Directory structure:
- `+Inbox/` — New notes by default if not specified
- `1-Projects/` — Active projects with defined outcomes
- `2-Areas/` — Ongoing areas of responsibility (e.g., Agents, Strategy, System)
- `3-Resources/` — Reference materials, templates, guides
- `4-Archives/` — Completed or inactive items
- `5-Tools/` — Scripts, automation, operational tools

Working with notes:
- cd into `~/ws/everything-monorepo/notes/` before editing
- Check the local `CLAUDE.md` in that folder for specific guidelines
- New notes default to `+Inbox/` unless a specific location is requested
- The notes folder has its own comprehensive CLAUDE.md with detailed processing rules
