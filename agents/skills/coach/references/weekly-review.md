## Phase 1: Inbox Clearing (20 min)

Inbox clearing is included but is NOT the identity of this review.

1. Clear notes inbox (`+Inbox/`): Process to PARA using `references/inbox-processing.md`.
2. Clear Todoist inbox: Process all items to appropriate projects or delete.
3. Brain dump: Ask Michael for any uncommitted thoughts — capture to `+Inbox/` or daily note.

## Phase 2: GTD Trigger-List Scan (15 min)

4. Scan all active projects in `1-Projects/`:
   - Still active? Next action clear? Any to archive?
5. Check other active commitments (cofounder considerations, relationships, health) as trigger list.
6. Check `@waiting` items for follow-ups.
7. Review any stalled or orphaned items.

## Phase 3: Dual-Track Weekly Plan (60 min)

This is the core of the review.

### Product Track

8. Define for this week:
   - **In-scope** (bullets)
   - **Out-of-scope** (bullets) — be explicit about what you're NOT doing
   - **Deliverables** (bullets)
   - **Top risks/unknowns** + mitigations
   - **Initial hill estimate per deliverable**: `uphill/downhill, ~X%, on track? y/n, note`

Source: Active project scope doc (`1-Projects/Everything AI - Demo Day/03-Scope/`).

### Investor Track

9. Same structure as Product Track:
   - In-scope, out-of-scope, deliverables, risks/unknowns, hill estimates

Source: Investor track plan (`1-Projects/Everything AI - Demo Day/04-Workstreams/Strategy - Investor + Demo Day track plan...md`).

### Red-Team Both Plans

10. Quick murphyjitsu per track: "What's the biggest risk to each plan this week? What's the weakest assumption?"

## Phase 4: Schedule + Deep Work (30 min)

11. Lock weekly big rocks (1-3 major outcomes for the week).
12. Schedule protected deep-work windows: minimum 3 blocks of 2+ hours each.
13. Define 1-line objective per deep-work block.
14. Load scheduling rules from SKILL.md and check calendar conflicts:
    ```bash
    gcal list --from monday --to sunday
    ```
15. Identify prep needed for any meetings or deadlines this week.

## Phase 5: Write-Up + Close (15 min)

16. Create or update weekly note in `Calendar/Weekly/YYYY-Www.md`.
17. Write "first day" plan: top outcomes + Pomodoro #1 + Pomodoro #2 in Monday's daily note.
18. Review past week's wins and patterns (pull from daily notes).
19. Update coach log if trends/policies emerged.

## Phase 6: Memory Review

20. Review `references/memory.md`:
    - Prune stale entries
    - Promote confirmed patterns
    - Note what's working / not working
    - Archive resolved commitments

## Phase 7: Session Feedback

21. "How was this session? 1-5."
22. "One small thing I could do better next time?"
23. Log to `references/memory.md` under Feedback.
