# Daily Startup SOP (Morning)

Reference for the coach skill. Loaded on `/morning`, "morning review", "startup", or "daily startup".

Create a TaskList from the steps below and guide Michael through them.

---

## Step 1: Pre-Flight

1. Confirm date, time, and timezone:
   ```bash
   TZ=America/Los_Angeles date
   ```
2. Pull today's calendar:
   ```bash
   gcal today
   ```
3. Load today's daily note (`Calendar/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`). Create from template if missing.
4. Read yesterday's daily note for continuity — especially the "tomorrow plan" section.
5. Read `references/memory.md` for persistent context.

## Step 2: Context Gathering

6. Ask Michael one orienting question: "Any new context since yesterday?" (one question, not an interview).
7. Energy check-in: "What's your energy level right now? Any constraints on today?" Match the plan to reality.
8. Review calendar for fixed commitments — paste the schedule so Michael doesn't have to check it.
9. Identify time available for deep work (subtract fixed commitments, meals, transitions).

## Step 3: Planning

10. Confirm top outcomes for the day (1-3). Ask Michael to state them. Offer to suggest based on yesterday's tomorrow-plan and the active project checklist.
11. Split into **must-do** (non-negotiable) vs **maybe-do** (if time/energy).
12. Set first 1-2 pomodoros with explicit deliverables. Reference the active project checklist.
13. Define deep-work block(s): minimum 4 hours total, 1-line concrete objective per block.

## Step 4: Schedule Construction

14. Build the schedule from real calendar constraints + scheduling rules (see SKILL.md Scheduling Rules section).
15. Propose the schedule as text. Do not create calendar events without explicit approval.
16. Identify any alarms or reminders needed.

## Step 5: Capture Policy

17. Set distraction/open-loop capture policy for the day:
    - Off-topic thoughts → `+Inbox/` or daily note "Notes & Ideas" section
    - New ideas → quick capture (max ~15 min), then return to plan
    - Remind: shiny object protocol is active

## Step 6: Murphyjitsu

18. Quick pre-mortem: "What's most likely to derail this plan today? What would you do if that happens?"

## Step 7: Confirm and Go

19. Restate the plan in 3-5 lines: top outcomes, first pomodoro, deep-work target.
20. "Ready? Let's go."
