# Evening Review (Lightweight)

## Goal

End the day with a truthful status and a clear plan for tomorrow.

## Minimum Inputs

- What shipped today (1-5 bullets)
- New risks/unknowns (0-3 bullets)
- Time tracked today (hours/minutes)
- Productivity today (0-10) + 1 sentence why
- Any distractions? (one line)
- Any improvements for tomorrow? (0-3 bullets)
- Did you do any coding/work that was out-of-scope? If yes: what triggered it?

## Steps

1. Calendar scan (next 1-2 days): use gcal.
2. Hill update: for each deliverable: `uphill/downhill, ~%, on track? y/n, note`.
3. Tomorrow plan:
   - Top outcomes (1-3)
   - Pomodoro #1 deliverable
   - Pomodoro #2 deliverable
   - Fixed-time commitments + prep tasks
4. Scope discipline (coach mode):
   - If out-of-scope work happened: identify the trigger and write a prevention rule for tomorrow.
   - Collaborative stance: ask for the user's idea first; offer to suggest 2-3 options if helpful.
5. Optional: record a trend/policy if it will change behavior tomorrow.
