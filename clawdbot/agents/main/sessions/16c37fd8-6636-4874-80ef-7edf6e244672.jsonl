The workspace files (AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, memory/*.md, etc.) are loaded at session start - these ARE shared across sessions because they're files on disk\n3. The daily memory pattern (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) is recommended in AGENTS.md for this exact reason\n4. I also have `sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_send` tools to interact with other sessions\n\nSo the answer is:\n- My \"in-context\" memory (the conversation) is NOT shared across sessions\n- File-based memory IS shared - if I write to a file, another session can read it\n- I can actively communicate with other sessions via the sessions_* tools\n\nThis is a good explanation of the architecture.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"Great question — this gets at the core architecture:\n\n**In-context memory (conversation) = NOT shared**\nEach session is isolated.

Let me summarize what I found:\n\n**imsg capabilities (from GitHub README):**\n- `imsg chats` — list recent conversations\n- `imsg history` — show recent messages for a chat\n- `imsg watch` — stream incoming messages (event-driven via filesystem events)\n- `imsg send` — send a message\n\nKey points from the README:\n- \"Read-only for receives; send uses AppleScript (no private APIs)\"\n- \"Event-driven watch via filesystem events\"\n- It reads from `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` directly\n- **There is NO gateway/server mode** - it's a CLI tool\n\nThe `watch` command does allow streaming incoming messages, but:\n1. It's event-driven (uses filesystem events on chat.db changes)\n2. Something still needs to run `imsg watch` as a persistent process\n3. There's no built-in webhook/callback mechanism to notify Clawdbot\n\nSo my earlier assessment was CORRECT:\n- iMessage via `imsg` is CLI-only\n- No gateway/push mechanism\n- To have auto-notification, we'd need to:\n  1. Run `imsg watch` as a background process\n  2. Have something parse its output and inject into Clawdbot\n\nNow for WhatsApp pairing status - I didn't find a specific file listing paired contacts. The pairing is likely handled at runtime by Clawdbot's WhatsApp gateway.

Run `imsg watch` persistently\n2. Parse output and inject it into Clawdbot\n\n**No built-in gateway.** My earlier explanation was accurate.\n\n---\n\n**WhatsApp paired contacts:**\n\nI couldn't find a specific \"paired contacts\" list file. The Clawdbot config just has policies:\n```json\n\"whatsapp\": {\n  \"dmPolicy\": \"pairing\",\n  \"groupPolicy\": \"pairing\"\n}\n```\n\nPairing approval likely happens at runtime when someone messages. I don't see a persisted allowlist — it may be session-based or stored elsewhere in Clawdbot's internals.\n\nWant me to dig deeper into the Clawdbot source to find where WhatsApp approvals are tracked? 🦉"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":8,"output":667,"cacheRead":27276,"cacheWrite":12745,"totalTokens":40696,"cost":{"input":0.00004,"output":0.016675000000000002,"cacheRead":0.013637999999999999,"cacheWrite":0.07965625,"total":0.11000925}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1767770081503}}
