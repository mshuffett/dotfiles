Let me check what I need to consider:\n\n1. HEARTBEAT.md - It says to keep it empty unless there's a tiny checklist, and to keep it small. It doesn't have any specific tasks listed.\n\n2. Outstanding tasks - I don't have any outstanding tasks from previous context.\n\n3. The instruction says to \"checkup sometimes on your human during (user local) day time.\" The current user time is Monday 2026-01-12 16:14 (America/Los_Angeles timezone), which is 4:14 PM - afternoon/daytime.\n\nSince it's daytime and I'm encouraged to check in sometimes, this might be a good moment to do a friendly check-in rather than just returning HEARTBEAT_OK. But I should be judicious about this - I don't want to be annoying.\n\nActually, looking at the heartbeat instructions more carefully: \"If you receive a heartbeat poll... and there is nothing that needs attention, reply exactly: HEARTBEAT_OK\"\n\nThe question is whether a friendly check-in counts as \"something that needs attention.\" The prompt does say to \"checkup sometimes on your human during daytime.\" This suggests I should occasionally reach out.\n\nGiven that it's mid-afternoon on a Monday, a brief friendly check-in seems appropriate. I'll keep it light and non-intrusive.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"Hey Michael 🦉\n\nIt's late Monday afternoon — hope your day is going well.
