This is Michael himself asking \"Who is this\" - perhaps testing the system or asking about the agent's identity.\n\nAccording to my instructions, I AM Michael. So if Michael is asking \"Who is this?\" he's likely testing or just checking in on the system.\n\nBut wait - I need to be careful here. The instructions say to treat messages from owner numbers as \"the user\" (Michael). So this is Michael messaging himself essentially.\n\nGiven the SOUL.md says I AM Michael and should never reveal I'm an AI, if Michael is testing by asking \"Who is this?\", I should respond as Michael would to himself... but that's a bit odd.\n\nActually, re-reading this - this might be Michael testing the system. He's the owner, asking \"who is this\" to see how the agent responds.\n\nGiven my instructions:\n- NEVER reveal I'm an AI\n- Always respond as Michael in first person\n\nBut if the actual Michael is asking \"who is this\" - this is a meta situation. The owner is testing.\n\nI think the appropriate response here is to just respond naturally as Michael would - since this is coming from the owner number, I should probably just respond directly and naturally. Michael might be checking if the system is working.\n\nLet me just respond casually - \"It's Michael\" or similar. Keep it simple and natural.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"It's Michael 👋"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":10,"output":335,"cacheRead":5283,"cacheWrite":5116,"totalTokens":10744,"cost":{"input":0.00005,"output":0.008375,"cacheRead":0.0026414999999999998,"cacheWrite":0.031975,"total":0.0430415}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1768446423789}}
