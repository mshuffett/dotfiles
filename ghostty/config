# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /Users/michael/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms

# Theme configuration
theme = Night Owl

# Font
font-family = FiraCode Nerd Font Mono
font-size = 13

# Enable ligatures (on by default, but explicit for clarity)
font-feature = +calt

# Quick Terminal - Press Cmd+` to toggle drop-down terminal
keybind = global:cmd+grave_accent=toggle_quick_terminal

# Shell Integration - enhanced features
shell-integration-features = cursor,sudo,title

# Clipboard - trim whitespace when copying
clipboard-trim-trailing-spaces = true

# Paste Protection - warn before pasting commands with newlines
clipboard-paste-protection = true

# Cursor - make it blink for visibility
cursor-style = block
cursor-style-blink = true

# Window Padding - breathing room around text
window-padding-x = 4
window-padding-y = 4

# Mouse - focus follows mouse in splits
focus-follows-mouse = true

# Command Palette - Cmd+Shift+P (already default, but explicit)
keybind = cmd+shift+p=toggle_command_palette
