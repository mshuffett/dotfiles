## 2. Rune Hauge (Sidepilot) - Meeting Minutes

**Original Message:**
> Hey Michelle and Michael,
>
> Thanks so much for putting this whole thing together! Attached is the signed agreement.
>
> I sent out notes to a handful of investors in my network. I'll start inviting more over the coming week after I get some signal on the messaging. A few I know socially or they're my old investors, so I'll just introduce them once they confirm if that works for you.
>
> Separately, if it's helpful on the sponsor side, I'm happy to make introductions. I know a handful of the sponsorship contacts at larger banks (SVB, Rho, etc.) from organizing YC alumni events in LA. Lmk if I can be of any help here!
>
> Cheers,
> Rune

**Generated Draft:**
> Hi Rune,
>
> Thanks for signing the agreement and offering to help with investor and sponsor introductions. The proactive outreach is much appreciated. I'd love to sync briefly about your network connections and potential sponsor leads.
>
> Do you have 15 minutes to chat this week? Here's my calendar: https://cal.com/everythingai/15min
>
> Cheers,
> Michael ⁂

**Actual Reply:**
> Hey Rune,
>
> This is awesome — you're crushing it on the investor intros. I have emailed all the ones I saw so far. Looks like a solid good group -- keep it coming.
>
> Would love some sponsor intros. The ones you mentioned looked good (Rho, SVB etc.) -- let me know if you need any additional info from me to send those out. I think we would offer them brand placement, invite-only events, the chance to intro them to founders, potentially an exclusive deal they can offer to the batch.
> ⁂

**Analysis:** Generated was too formal and asked for a call. Actual was warmer ("crushing it"), acknowledged specific progress, and provided concrete sponsor pitch details.

## Prompt Improvements Made

1. "calendar" category only for automated notifications, not human messages about events
2. Demo day in subject + interest → use RSVP link, not calendar
3. Investor from fund → proactively mention sponsor opportunities
4. When unclear → ask clarifying question + offer call
5. Address the person directly, not the introducer
6. Short acknowledgments are valid responses
7. Warmer tone: "awesome", "crushing it", "glad you can make it"
