## Research Question
[Original user query]

## Research Methodology (verbatim)

This document will remain objective and factual. It does not contain any recommendations or implementation suggestions.
Open questions will not ask Why things haven't been built or what should be built in the future.

There is no "implementation" section - that is intentional.

## Summary
[High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]

## Detailed Findings

### [Component/Area 1]
- Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))
- How it connects to other components
- Current implementation details (without evaluation)

#### Testing patterns
- [concrete examples of how this component is tested in the codebase]
- [unit or integration or e2e or whatever else exists]

### [Component/Area 2]
...

## Code References
- `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there
- `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block

## Architecture Documentation
[Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]

## Historical Context (from rpi/)
[Relevant insights from rpi/ directory with references]
- `rpi/tasks/eng-XXXX-something/YYYY-MM-DD-research.md` - Historical decision about X
- `rpi/shared/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y

## Open Questions
[Any areas that need further investigation - keep it focused to codebase understanding - "How does X Work" not "Should Y be the case"]
