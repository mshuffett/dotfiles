# Evening Shutdown

Help me close out the day properly.

1. **Review**: What got done today? What didn't?
2. **Capture**: Any loose threads, ideas, or open loops to capture?
3. **Tomorrow**: What's the first task for tomorrow morning?
4. **Clear**: Help me mentally close out

Ask me:
- What was accomplished today?
- What's still weighing on my mind?
- What would make tomorrow start smoothly?

Then help me create a clean handoff for tomorrow's session.
