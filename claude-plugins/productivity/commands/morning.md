# Morning Routine

Help me start the day with clarity.

1. **Check context**: What was I working on yesterday? (Review recent git activity, open tasks)
2. **Set priorities**: What are the 3-5 things that matter most today?
3. **Identify blockers**: Anything that could derail focus?
4. **First task**: What should I start with right now?

Ask me:
- How am I feeling this morning?
- What's the one thing that would make today a success?
- Are there any time-sensitive items?

Then help me create a focused plan for the day.
