## Key Learnings from This Session

1. **Assignee filtering is critical** - Initial export missed assignee field
2. **Descriptions add valuable context** - Many tasks had rich descriptions
3. **Toggle nesting requires tabs** - NOT blockquote `>` syntax
4. **Hyperlinks in titles break callouts** - Avoid `[**bold**](url)` pattern
