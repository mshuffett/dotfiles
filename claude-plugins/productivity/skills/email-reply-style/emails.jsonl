There's a tension in what you shared–on one hand, \"I'd\n> regret not doing this,\" and on the other, \"I'm worried about getting stuck\n> with something that isn't a good use of my life.\"\n>\n> The oscillation you described–between high-energy mission states and\n> baseline business creation mode where you lose the why–might suggest you're\n> still working out whether you're fully committed to this path. And that\n> would make complete sense after the Compose experience.\n>\n> Why this matters for coaching:\n>\n> The work I do is most effective when a founder has landed on \"I'm building\n> this company\" and needs support executing at a higher level. What you might\n> be navigating is the question that comes *before* that–the \"is this the\n> thing\" question rather than the \"how do I build this thing\" question.\n>\n> If that's accurate, coaching might feel like it's addressing symptoms\n> rather than the root. And given your experience with 5-10 previous coaches,\n> we'd want to avoid that pattern.\n>\n> A suggestion:\n>\n> Before engaging another coach (whether me or someone else), try this\n> 30-day experiment:\n>\n> Pick ONE thing–fundraising, hiring, or building. Do only that for 30 days.\n> When the voice says \"but I should be doing X instead,\" write down:\n>\n>    1. What triggered the shift?\n>    2. What am I afraid will happen if I stay on this current path?\n>    3. What am I hoping will happen if I switch?\n>\n> Track this daily. At the end of 30 days, you may have more clarity about\n> whether this is an execution challenge (very coachable) or a conviction\n> question (different work needed first).\n>\n> Next steps:\n>\n> Do the experiment, and we can reconnect in mid-December to see what you\n> learned. If you've found clarity on your commitment to the path and still\n> want coaching, we can revisit whether working together makes sense.\n>\n> If it turns out you need support on the \"is this the thing\" question\n> first, I can point you toward people who specialize in that kind of work.\n> Either way, rooting for you to get clear.\n>\n> Dileepan\n> On Wed, Nov 5, 2025 at 10:28 AM Michael Shuffett <michael@geteverything.ai>\n> wrote:\n>\n>> Hi Dileepan,\n>>\n>> Thanks for the invite — looking forward to our conversation today.\n>>\n>> Here’s a quick overview ahead of time:\n>>\n>> Current Build\n>> I’m at the early stage with geteverything.ai — I raised a small\n>> friends-and-family pre-seed and am gearing up for another raise soon.

{"id":"hello@dileepansiva.com-Re--follow-up","content":"Subject: Re: follow-up\nTo: hello@dileepansiva.com\nis_reply: true\nOriginal: Michael,\nGreat, invite sent. To make our time together as valuable as possible, I'd\nappreciate a quick note beforehand with:\nYour Current Build:\n* Where are you in the journey with geteverything.ai (\nhttp://geteverything.ai ) ? (stage, any funding raised, team size now and\nin 6 months)\n* What's the specific leadership challenge or transition you're navigating\nright now?\n* What made coaching feel worth exploring at this moment?\nWhat You're Looking For:\n* What would make coaching actually valuable\n---\nMichael: Hi Dileepan,\n\nThanks for the invite — looking forward to our conversation today.\n\nHere’s a quick overview ahead of time:\n\nCurrent Build\nI’m at the early stage with geteverything.ai — I raised a small friends-and-family pre-seed and am gearing up for another raise soon. Right now it’s just me and a few part-time collaborators, though I expect that to grow over the next six months.\n\nThe main leadership challenge I’m navigating is the tension between multiple directions: fundraising, hiring, and building. I’ll often get to a point where I’m convinced THIS is the right path — I commit fully for a few days, and then something new or shiny pulls my attention. It’s not that I don’t know what to do; it’s more that my focus keeps shifting. I’ve been diagnosed with mild ADHD, and while it’s manageable, it definitely plays into the pattern. I’d like some outside perspective and accountability to create more sustained forward motion.\n\nWhy Coaching Now\nI saw a few people in the YC community mention coaching and it reminded me that structured reflection and accountability can help cut through this kind of split focus. I’ve done coaching before and found it helpful when it added clear frameworks and follow-through.\n\nWhat I’m Looking For\nCoaching would be valuable if it helps me move decisively and consistently — reducing that internal tug-of-war and turning decisions into results. I’ll know it’s working if I’m executing what I’ve already decided with less friction and more output.\n\nIn terms of qualities, I value outcomes and clear thinking — someone who uses the right tool for the job, approaches things from first principles, and can explain the reasoning behind their conclusions. I appreciate directness and care in balance, and ideally a coach who takes real ownership — someone who tracks progress, brings observations back, and isn’t afraid to have opinions.\n\nBackground with Coaching\nI’ve worked with several coaches, advisors, and therapists. The main gaps I’ve found were too little homework, too little structure around the journey itself, and not enough accountability between sessions. I’d like a coach who helps build and track a concrete map of progress, not just hold a single conversation each week.\n\nPractical Details\n• Budget: Low thousands per month\n• Decision Maker: Just me\n• Timeline: Ready to start immediately or within the next week\n\nLooking forward to connecting and diving into it.\n\nBest,\nMichael"}

Our conversation has me convinced a partnership\ncould be incredibly powerful, and I'm keen to move quickly given the\ncurrent market conditions.\n\n*De-Risk Shipping*\n\nTo explore this collaboration seriously, my first step is to assess the\ncurrent code, product, and process. The goal is to map out a clear path to\nshipping within a month.\n\nTo start, could you invite me to the next team sync or daily to observe?\nI'll also send this email to Mustafa\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yBGCUIp68y4jqwGnZCQ4MDrY9GZtAuIG9COLhcOLOlc/edit?usp=sharing>\nif it looks good to you (or feel free to send one instead).  I'll keep you\nin the loop on any emails and meetings (cc / optional).\n\n*The Bigger Picture: A Partnership*\n\nI'm genuinely excited about our strong alignment—from the charitable giving\nand small business focus to the consciousness expansion level. It’s a great\nfoundation.\n\nI see the most fruitful path forward as a true partnership, structured\naround 50/50 (44%/44%). I’d own Tech, Product, and AI, while you’d own the\nBusiness side (GTM, sales, finance). We can explore adding additional\npartners as needed and I am happy to go to 1/3 etc. if we both agree that\nthe value-add is there.\n\nOur skills are highly complementary. You bring 10+ years of domain\nexperience, sales, finance, and a very strong network. I bring a deep\nbackground in data, product, engineering, startups, and a strong startup /\nhiring network (YC, Sequoia, etc.). Together, we can accelerate the roadmap\nand fundraising significantly.\n\nI've spent this year thinking and building around the concept of an\nEverything Agency in search of a bookstore and I think you may have found\nan excellent beachhead. I'm ready to build it now.\n\n*Action Items:*\n\nMichael - Will await approval and start syncing with Mustafa and team on\ntech and where I can plug in and accelerate\n\nDan\n1. Invite me to the next team sync/daily\n2. Send over the pitch deck outline when you have it if you want a review\n3. Send over the candidates that you have already if you would like feedback\n4.

Overall, this looks good and we’d like to keep moving forward quickly. As a next step, it would be helpful to receive the full terms so we can verify that they meet the attached lease requirements. We’ll also attach those requirements to this note for reference. We just have a few questions and requirements to make sure everything lines up with the lease and our use of the space:\n\n1. Company Name Correction\n\n--------------------------\n\n* \n\nPlease update all documents and certificates to reflect the correct company name: *Everything AI, Inc.* (not “Education AI”).\n\n2. Required Coverage Adjustments (per lease requirements)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n* \n\n*Workers’ Compensation & Employers’ Liability*\n\n* \n\nPlease add a Workers’ Comp/Employers’ Liability policy.\n\n* \n\nI am the sole founder/officer and currently have no employees. Please bind a minimum premium policy with me excluded from coverage. Employers’ Liability should carry $1,000,000 limits as required by the lease.\n\n* \n\n*Commercial General Liability*\n\n* \n\nMaintain $2M per occurrence + $3M umbrella for total $5M (which matches the $5M per occurrence requirement).\n\n* \n\nPlease confirm contractual liability is included.\n\n* \n\n*Property / “All Risk” Coverage*\n\n* \n\nAt present, the space is essentially empty and we do not yet have significant property or improvements in place. The $202,000 property limit is sufficient for now.\n\n* \n\nPlease confirm that tenant improvements can be endorsed onto the policy mid-term once we complete buildout.\n\n* \n\nPlease also confirm coverage is on a replacement cost and “All Risk” basis.\n\n* \n\n*Landlord Protection Requirements*\n\nPlease make sure the policy is set up so that:\n\n* \n\n*Landlord and related parties are covered under our policy* (they are named as “additional insureds”). The required building and entities are:\n\n* \n\nBuilding: Two Embarcadero Center\n\n* \n\nAdditional Insureds:\n\n• Embarcadero Center Associates, a California general partnership\n\n• Boston Properties LLC, a Delaware limited liability company\n\n• BP EC2 Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company\n\n• Boston Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation\n\n• Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership\n\n• BP Management, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership\n\n* \n\n*Our policy pays first* if there’s ever a claim, and the landlord’s insurance doesn’t have to contribute.\n\n* \n\n*Our insurer can’t go after the landlord* to recover money after paying a claim (waiver of subrogation).\n\n* \n\n*Landlord gets 30 days’ advance notice* if our policy is canceled, reduced, or not renewed.\n\n3. Gallery / Artwork Coverage\n\n-----------------------------\n\nOur plan will be to require artists to carry their own insurance and provide a Certificate of Insurance naming us and landlord as Additional Insured. At the same time, please let us know if Hartford offers a Fine Arts / Bailee Coverage endorsement, and provide a quote for $100,000 of coverage. This would be considered an add-on that we would look to add later, once we are actively bringing art into the space. Also, could you clarify whether the current $202,000 property limit includes or excludes artwork?\n\n4. Certificates of Insurance\n\n----------------------------\n\nPlease confirm that once the policy is bound, you will issue certificates reflecting the above requirements for the landlord.\n\n5. Event Coverage\n\n-----------------\n\nCould you also confirm whether our coverage extends to private events, public events, and attendees in the space?\n\nOnce these updates are made, we are ready to proceed with binding coverage. Please also provide a more detailed terms document, as so far we have only received a high-level summary. If you can help us confirm these points and ensure we’re set up to meet the lease requirements, we’d like to keep the process moving quickly.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichael Shuffett\n\nEverything AI, Inc."}

{"id":"udit@metaplanet.com-Introducing-Everything-AI","content":"Subject: Introducing Everything AI\nTo: udit@metaplanet.com\nis_reply: false\nOriginal: N/A\n---\nMichael: Hi Udit,\n\nThanks for the help connecting with like-minded investors.\n\nEverything AI (EAI) turns complex projects into reliable results by\norchestrating\nhuman and AI agents on its agentic marketplace to deliver solutions that\nare consistently cheaper, better, and faster.\n\nWe're building EAI based on these core convictions about the market's\ntrajectory:\n\n   - Intelligence is a moving frontier: The increasing prevalence of\n   intelligence predictably and rapidly devalues static software and\n   previous-generation AI models, while paving the way for newer,\n   higher-value approaches.\n   -\n\n   Agents are Human OR AI: To remain relevant, companies must adopt an\n'agent-first'\n   strategy, embracing both, not just human- or AI-centric approaches.\n   -\n\n   Specialization is fundamental: Complex work will always require\n   specialized (human or AI) agents with verifiable credentials, distinct\n   resource access, or superior task-specific efficiency.\n\nTo capitalize on these shifts, we are creating an Everything Agency: a\nself-evolving marketplace of human and AI agents. On EAI, agents execute\ntasks while also building and exchanging new tools, services, and other\nspecialized agents directly among themselves. This creates a powerful\ncontinuously\ncompounding network effect and flywheel — solving the intelligence frontier\nproblem by replacing point solutions with a continuously evolving frontier\nof capabilities.\n\nEAI is building a multi-agent orchestration model that turns complex\nrequests into multi-agent plans, factoring in past performance data and\nagent (human/AI) evals. This unlocks our ability to deliver cheaper,\nfaster, and more reliable results in a way that scales with the size of the\nnetwork and our performance data — creating a sustainable competitive\nadvantage.\n\nThe opportunity for orchestrated agentic work is massive. It represents a\nsuperset of the $60 trillion global human labor market, and we believe the\nemerging AI labor market will not only integrate with but rapidly eclipse\nthe scale of traditional human labor.\n\nEAI is working to realize a future where achieving any result becomes as easy\nas opening a faucet. We believe that democratizing AI-driven value creation\nis essential for empowering individuals, fostering a vibrant ecosystem, and\naccelerating broad technological progress.\n\nMy commitment to this vision is grounded in over a decade of relevant\nexperience, including: scaling AI initiatives at Amazon ($6B GMV impact),\nco-founding Compose AI (YC, backed by David Sacks & Sequoia, to 1M MAU),\nand bootstrapping an AI consultancy to $10M ARR.\n\nWe are seeking partners who share our vision for the transformative\npotential of agentic ecosystems and are keen to make foundational\ninvestments in early-stage, high-impact ventures. A brief call would allow\nme to demo EAI's core functionality and explore if there's a strong mutual\nfit.\n\nThanks for passing this along.\n\nBest,\n\nMichael Shuffett\n\nFounder, Everything AI"}
