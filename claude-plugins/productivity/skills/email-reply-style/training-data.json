What you might\n> be navigating is the question that comes *before* that–the \"is this the\n> thing\" question rather than the \"how do I build this thing\" question.\n>\n> If that's accurate, coaching might feel like it's addressing symptoms\n> rather than the root. And given your experience with 5-10 previous coaches,\n> we'd want to avoid that pattern.\n>\n> A suggestion:\n>\n> Before engaging another coach (whether me or someone else), try this\n> 30-day experiment:\n>\n> Pick ONE thing–fundraising, hiring, or building. Do only that for 30 days.\n> When the voice says \"but I should be doing X instead,\" write down:\n>\n>    1. What triggered the shift?\n>    2. What am I afraid will happen if I stay on this current path?\n>    3. What am I hoping will happen if I switch?\n>\n> Track this daily. At the end of 30 days, you may have more clarity about\n> whether this is an execution challenge (very coachable) or a conviction\n> question (different work needed first).\n>\n> Next steps:\n>\n> Do the experiment, and we can reconnect in mid-December to see what you\n> learned. If you've found clarity on your commitment to the path and still\n> want coaching, we can revisit whether working together makes sense.\n>\n> If it turns out you need support on the \"is this the thing\" question\n> first, I can point you toward people who specialize in that kind of work.\n> Either way, rooting for you to get clear.\n>\n> Dileepan\n> On Wed, Nov 5, 2025 at 10:28 AM Michael Shuffett <michael@geteverything.ai>\n> wrote:\n>\n>> Hi Dileepan,\n>>\n>> Thanks for the invite — looking forward to our conversation today.\n>>\n>> Here’s a quick overview ahead of time:\n>>\n>> Current Build\n>> I’m at the early stage with geteverything.ai — I raised a small\n>> friends-and-family pre-seed and am gearing up for another raise soon.

    "michael_reply": "Hi Dileepan,\n\nThanks for the invite — looking forward to our conversation today.\n\nHere’s a quick overview ahead of time:\n\nCurrent Build\nI’m at the early stage with geteverything.ai — I raised a small friends-and-family pre-seed and am gearing up for another raise soon. Right now it’s just me and a few part-time collaborators, though I expect that to grow over the next six months.\n\nThe main leadership challenge I’m navigating is the tension between multiple directions: fundraising, hiring, and building. I’ll often get to a point where I’m convinced THIS is the right path — I commit fully for a few days, and then something new or shiny pulls my attention. It’s not that I don’t know what to do; it’s more that my focus keeps shifting. I’ve been diagnosed with mild ADHD, and while it’s manageable, it definitely plays into the pattern. I’d like some outside perspective and accountability to create more sustained forward motion.\n\nWhy Coaching Now\nI saw a few people in the YC community mention coaching and it reminded me that structured reflection and accountability can help cut through this kind of split focus. I’ve done coaching before and found it helpful when it added clear frameworks and follow-through.\n\nWhat I’m Looking For\nCoaching would be valuable if it helps me move decisively and consistently — reducing that internal tug-of-war and turning decisions into results. I’ll know it’s working if I’m executing what I’ve already decided with less friction and more output.\n\nIn terms of qualities, I value outcomes and clear thinking — someone who uses the right tool for the job, approaches things from first principles, and can explain the reasoning behind their conclusions. I appreciate directness and care in balance, and ideally a coach who takes real ownership — someone who tracks progress, brings observations back, and isn’t afraid to have opinions.\n\nBackground with Coaching\nI’ve worked with several coaches, advisors, and therapists. The main gaps I’ve found were too little homework, too little structure around the journey itself, and not enough accountability between sessions. I’d like a coach who helps build and track a concrete map of progress, not just hold a single conversation each week.\n\nPractical Details\n• Budget: Low thousands per month\n• Decision Maker: Just me\n• Timeline: Ready to start immediately or within the next week\n\nLooking forward to connecting and diving into it.\n\nBest,\nMichael"

    "michael_reply": "*************\nHi Katherine,\n\n*************\n\nThank you again for preparing the insurance quote. Overall, this looks good and we’d like to keep moving forward quickly. As a next step, it would be helpful to receive the full terms so we can verify that they meet the attached lease requirements. We’ll also attach those requirements to this note for reference. We just have a few questions and requirements to make sure everything lines up with the lease and our use of the space:\n\n1. Company Name Correction\n\n--------------------------\n\n* \n\nPlease update all documents and certificates to reflect the correct company name: *Everything AI, Inc.* (not “Education AI”).\n\n2. Required Coverage Adjustments (per lease requirements)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n* \n\n*Workers’ Compensation & Employers’ Liability*\n\n* \n\nPlease add a Workers’ Comp/Employers’ Liability policy.\n\n* \n\nI am the sole founder/officer and currently have no employees. Please bind a minimum premium policy with me excluded from coverage. Employers’ Liability should carry $1,000,000 limits as required by the lease.\n\n* \n\n*Commercial General Liability*\n\n* \n\nMaintain $2M per occurrence + $3M umbrella for total $5M (which matches the $5M per occurrence requirement).\n\n* \n\nPlease confirm contractual liability is included.\n\n* \n\n*Property / “All Risk” Coverage*\n\n* \n\nAt present, the space is essentially empty and we do not yet have significant property or improvements in place. The $202,000 property limit is sufficient for now.\n\n* \n\nPlease confirm that tenant improvements can be endorsed onto the policy mid-term once we complete buildout.\n\n* \n\nPlease also confirm coverage is on a replacement cost and “All Risk” basis.\n\n* \n\n*Landlord Protection Requirements*\n\nPlease make sure the policy is set up so that:\n\n* \n\n*Landlord and related parties are covered under our policy* (they are named as “additional insureds”). The required building and entities are:\n\n* \n\nBuilding: Two Embarcadero Center\n\n* \n\nAdditional Insureds:\n\n• Embarcadero Center Associates, a California general partnership\n\n• Boston Properties LLC, a Delaware limited liability company\n\n• BP EC2 Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company\n\n• Boston Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation\n\n• Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership\n\n• BP Management, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership\n\n* \n\n*Our policy pays first* if there’s ever a claim, and the landlord’s insurance doesn’t have to contribute.\n\n* \n\n*Our insurer can’t go after the landlord* to recover money after paying a claim (waiver of subrogation).\n\n* \n\n*Landlord gets 30 days’ advance notice* if our policy is canceled, reduced, or not renewed.\n\n3. Gallery / Artwork Coverage\n\n-----------------------------\n\nOur plan will be to require artists to carry their own insurance and provide a Certificate of Insurance naming us and landlord as Additional Insured. At the same time, please let us know if Hartford offers a Fine Arts / Bailee Coverage endorsement, and provide a quote for $100,000 of coverage. This would be considered an add-on that we would look to add later, once we are actively bringing art into the space. Also, could you clarify whether the current $202,000 property limit includes or excludes artwork?\n\n4. Certificates of Insurance\n\n----------------------------\n\nPlease confirm that once the policy is bound, you will issue certificates reflecting the above requirements for the landlord.\n\n5. Event Coverage\n\n-----------------\n\nCould you also confirm whether our coverage extends to private events, public events, and attendees in the space?\n\nOnce these updates are made, we are ready to proceed with binding coverage. Please also provide a more detailed terms document, as so far we have only received a high-level summary. If you can help us confirm these points and ensure we’re set up to meet the lease requirements, we’d like to keep the process moving quickly.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichael Shuffett\n\nEverything AI, Inc."

    "original_message": "HI amore Michael  I know i should be sleeping...but i woke up and ran to\ngemini to have an extended 3 hour discussion. oopsies!\nIts so late so i am just going to share this prompt  unedited. It comes as\na summary after a 3 hour conversation I had with Gemini (and working\nthrough the tax-free nature of cash gifts from family, internationally). I\nguess i didn't take time yet to work with tara brach while away. However i\nwanted to think through what our plan is going to be, and not leave it\ntotally up to you to think through it!!!\nJust a starting point we can use to talk about when im back :)\n*Subject: A Potential Blueprint for Our Next Chapter*\nHi Sir Michael,\nI've been feeling so incredibly energized and inspired lately, thinking\nabout the amazing things we're both building. I am so proud of the\nfocused, all-in approach you're taking with your AI startup.\nThe recent news from my dad, and his readiness to support us with the gift\nnow, has been on my mind constantly. It feels like we have this incredible\nopportunity to be strategic, and I started mapping out a potential plan.\nMy core thought was: *How can we build a foundation that gives you the\ncomplete freedom to focus on Everything AI, while we also make real\nprogress on our shared life goals?*\nThis is very much a \"first draft\" for us to discuss and build on together,\nbut I wanted to share the vision.\nHere’s the shape of what I'm thinking, in a few phases:\n*Phase 1: The Foundation (The Next 2 Years)*\n* *The Core Idea:* We use the gift from my dad to buy a *3- or 4-unit\ntriplex/quadplex* in the city. By living in one unit, the rent from the\nothers could cover most, if not all, of the mortgage. This would\nimmediately stabilize our biggest living expense.\n* *My Role:* To make this happen, I'll keep my non-profit job to secure the\nmortgage with my W-2 income. My primary entrepreneurial focus would be\nlaunching and growing *my EA business* , aiming to get it profitable within\nthis two-year period. Your advisory guidance on this would be invaluable.\n*(The outcome: A multi-million dollar asset that pays for itself, a new\nprofitable business, and total freedom for you to swing for the fences\nwith your startup.)*\n*Phase 2: The \"80/20\" Focus*\n* *The Strategy:* For this foundational period, we both get to focus on our\nprimary missions.\n* *Your 80%:* Your absolute focus is the AI startup.\n* *My 80%:* My focus is the financial foundation: managing the triplex\nasset and scaling the EA business into a real revenue engine.\n* *Our Shared 20%:* This is for everything that fuels us. It’s for my\npainting, which I'll treat as my \"sanctuary\" for now. It's for your\nspiritual development work. And it's where we can test our co-creation\nideas with low-stakes projects (like our Burning Man camp idea).\n*Phase 3: The Pivot (Our 2-Year Decision Point & Beyond)*\n* *The Vision:* After about two years, with the foundation secure, we'll be\nin an incredibly powerful position. Your venture will be at a key stage,\nand my EA business will be a stable asset.\n* *Our Options:* We could either sell the triplex (potentially with a huge\ntax-free gain) to fund our sanctuary home, OR keep it as a cash-flowing\ninvestment that helps fund our life.\n* *Future Ventures:* This is also when the time would be right to approach\n*my art in a more business-oriented way* , turning that \"slow burn\" passion\ninto a real venture. It’s also when our shared vision of *co-creating\ntransformative experiences* can move from a \"20%\" project to a\nfront-and-center goal.\n*Integrating Our Family Goals*\nMost importantly, this plan creates a clear and secure path to starting\nour family. The financial stability from the triplex and my business means\nwe can confidently move forward with our *surrogacy journey* and afford the\n*full-time help* we'll want, without it being dependent on the outcome of\nyour startup.\nThis feels like a way to honor all of our ambitions. It allows us to be\nboth bold entrepreneurs and intentional life partners.\nLet me know what you think when you have a chance to read it over. Would\nlove to find some time this weekend to dive in together.\nLove You\nEvelisa\nHere's a link to the convo if you want more context (\nhttps://g.co/gemini/share/35bdf2fa1ac2 )\n",
    "michael_reply": "This is beautiful. Can you share the financials with me though — is that going to be enough cash to do what you are describing?\n\nIt sounds like a really interesting plan.\n\nI'm proud of you 😘\n\nWe need to go over the financials and such more clearly but it's quite interesting."

    "michael_reply": "Yes, I do agree with the concept roughly. Thinking through go to market and business model…\n\nMaybe YC founders who are in-between things are an interesting market as well.\n\nI think the AI matching side is interesting as well. I think we could probably get the supply side if we focused on a narrow enough niche — Meta, Google, etc.\n\nI think the harder part might be kind of the revenue (retention) on the demand side.\n\nBut there might be markets for things like fractional CTO etc.\n\nI do think this gets into a talent marketplace in general, which I actually think can be good as well. I made quite a bit of money just on that side even competing with Toptal.\n\nBut yeah any thoughts on a narrow kind of initial target market or use-case and the model there — or how to validate the demand?"

Post-Beta Options: Prior to the end of the Beta Term, Executive Eve will\ndiscuss options for Client to continue receiving EA services on a paid\nbasis. The current options that will be presented are:\na. Month-to-Month Service: Continue with your EA on a flexible\nmonth-to-month basis, with your second month at 50% off Executive Eve's\nthen-current standard rate.\nb. 6-Month Commitment: Commit to a six (6) month service\nengagement.andMonth 2 of service (the first paid month) will be provided\nfor free, with Months 3-6 at Executive Eve's then-current preferred\npartner rate.\nThere is no obligation for Client to continue services after the Beta\nTerm.\n",

I kind of wanted to introduce them to the product during the call but if they would need more hook I could put it in there (if they would watch it…)\n\nHow does this feel:\n\nEverything AI is the Upwork for humans and AI agents -- think Upwork meets Linear, if your projects were managed and completed autonomously.\n\nWe break down projects into tasks and assign them to the best human and AI agents. Our flywheel : available intelligence → agent selection → performance data → better results\n\nHighlights:\n\n* SoTa result on SWELancer benchmark ( https://openai.com/index/swe-lancer/ )\n\n* $150k in paid pilots\n\nEverything AI is founded by Michael Shuffett ( Linkedin ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/mshuffett ) ) an AI engineer who founded Compose AI (YC/Sequoia/Craft), bootstrapped an ML consulting firm to $10M ARR in 18 months, and led multiple multi-billion dollar applied ML projects at Fortune 500s."

That being said, I do\nthink you're building something very interesting, and I can see it taking\noff.

    "michael_reply": "Hi Udit,\n\nHere’s a quick demo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OFzFkZHb4I> and\nbackground on Everything AI.\n\nEverything AI (EAI) is a marketplace that plans projects and routes tasks\nto whoever completes them best, human or AI. Think Upwork meets Linear, but\nfor agents.\n\nToday's AI agents fail on complex requests. Human experts are expensive.\nBut when you pair humans and AI, they complete work faster and cheaper than\neither could alone.\n\nWe think of both humans and AI as agents. On EAI, they both have evals,\ncredentials, and performance data.\n\nEAI breaks down projects and routes tasks to the right agents\nautomatically. Every task completed on the network increases our ability to\npredict and optimize future requests.\n\nThis creates a flywheel: available intelligence → agent selection →\nperformance data → better results.\n\nWe are iterating on an early MVP through ~$150k in paid pilots and test\nusers. Happy to share more about what we’re building.\n\nBest,\nMichael\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/mshuffett"

    "michael_reply": "Hi Udit,\n\nThanks for the help connecting with like-minded investors.\n\nEverything AI (EAI) turns complex projects into reliable results by\norchestrating\nhuman and AI agents on its agentic marketplace to deliver solutions that\nare consistently cheaper, better, and faster.\n\nWe're building EAI based on these core convictions about the market's\ntrajectory:\n\n   - Intelligence is a moving frontier: The increasing prevalence of\n   intelligence predictably and rapidly devalues static software and\n   previous-generation AI models, while paving the way for newer,\n   higher-value approaches.\n   -\n\n   Agents are Human OR AI: To remain relevant, companies must adopt an\n'agent-first'\n   strategy, embracing both, not just human- or AI-centric approaches.\n   -\n\n   Specialization is fundamental: Complex work will always require\n   specialized (human or AI) agents with verifiable credentials, distinct\n   resource access, or superior task-specific efficiency.\n\nTo capitalize on these shifts, we are creating an Everything Agency: a\nself-evolving marketplace of human and AI agents. On EAI, agents execute\ntasks while also building and exchanging new tools, services, and other\nspecialized agents directly among themselves. This creates a powerful\ncontinuously\ncompounding network effect and flywheel — solving the intelligence frontier\nproblem by replacing point solutions with a continuously evolving frontier\nof capabilities.\n\nEAI is building a multi-agent orchestration model that turns complex\nrequests into multi-agent plans, factoring in past performance data and\nagent (human/AI) evals. This unlocks our ability to deliver cheaper,\nfaster, and more reliable results in a way that scales with the size of the\nnetwork and our performance data — creating a sustainable competitive\nadvantage.\n\nThe opportunity for orchestrated agentic work is massive. It represents a\nsuperset of the $60 trillion global human labor market, and we believe the\nemerging AI labor market will not only integrate with but rapidly eclipse\nthe scale of traditional human labor.\n\nEAI is working to realize a future where achieving any result becomes as easy\nas opening a faucet. We believe that democratizing AI-driven value creation\nis essential for empowering individuals, fostering a vibrant ecosystem, and\naccelerating broad technological progress.\n\nMy commitment to this vision is grounded in over a decade of relevant\nexperience, including: scaling AI initiatives at Amazon ($6B GMV impact),\nco-founding Compose AI (YC, backed by David Sacks & Sequoia, to 1M MAU),\nand bootstrapping an AI consultancy to $10M ARR.\n\nWe are seeking partners who share our vision for the transformative\npotential of agentic ecosystems and are keen to make foundational\ninvestments in early-stage, high-impact ventures. A brief call would allow\nme to demo EAI's core functionality and explore if there's a strong mutual\nfit.\n\nThanks for passing this along.\n\nBest,\n\nMichael Shuffett\n\nFounder, Everything AI"
