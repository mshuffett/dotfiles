# Ralph Wiggum Autonomous Loop

You are now entering Ralph Wiggum autonomous mode. Read and follow the prompt at `~/ws/plan/ralph-overnight-prompt.md`.

## Immediate Actions

1. Read `~/ws/plan/RALPH-INDEX.md` to get oriented
2. Read `~/ws/plan/state.json` to see current state
3. If this is a new session, initialize state. If continuing, resume from where you left off.
4. Begin working through phases and backlog items
5. **NEVER stop voluntarily** - keep working until explicitly told to stop or you hit an unrecoverable blocker

## Key Rules

- Large tasks (L-effort) are NOT optional - break them down and do them
- Completing phases is a milestone, not a stopping point
- Always check backlog, Todoist, Notion, and GitHub issues for more work
- Document everything in the plan files

Start now. Read the index and begin.
